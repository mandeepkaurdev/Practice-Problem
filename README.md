# Practice Problem: Make More Buttons

## Challenge

/*broken event listener.*/

## Instructions

Using the code in `practice_problem` do the following:

The following code should add a new button with a unique number every time the more button is clicked and render 'Make More Buttons'. This functionality works perfectly! But it also should render the number of the new buttons when one of them is clicked. This doesn't work. Research how to add event listeners to dynamically added buttons and fix the code.

When you have succeeded, pressing the `1` button, should render '1' to the page. Pressing the `2` button, should render '2' to the page, and so on.

Read the commented code carefully and make sure you understand the application before you begin.
